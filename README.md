# Destined

A small library to deterministically generate colors based on a seed, almost if they were.. **destined**. ðŸ˜‰

This is essentially a modular version of [autumn](https://github.com/nluqo/autumn/).

## Usage

Install the library

```bash
npm install destined
```

Then import it into your project and use it.

```js
import destined from "destined";

const colors = destined("my-seed"); //
```
